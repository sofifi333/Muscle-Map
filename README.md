## Overview

**Muscle Map** is a React application designed to help users explore human anatomy and learn exercises targeting specific muscle groups.  
Each page features:

-  A high-quality muscle image  
-  A clear scientific description  
-  Exercises organized by *muscle subgroups* (e.g., long head vs short head)  
-  A reusable page architecture so new muscles can be added easily  

Built with an emphasis on **component reusability**, **clean CSS layout**, and **intuitive navigation**.
